    <h1>From C64 to GNU/Linux</h1>

    <p>
        I received my first computer at the age of 14 at the day of my
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation">Konfirmation</a>.
        It was a <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/C64">Commodore 64</a> with the
        floppy drive VC 1541. Later I also acquired a Commodore monitor and was
        ready to try all kinds of games and learn some BASIC, but soon I moved on
        to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6510">6510</a>
        Assembler programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        I studied the book
        <a href="http://www.google.de/search?q=programmierung+6502">Programmierung
            des 6502</a> by Rodnay Zaks and wrote a a sprite editor
        that used the multi background color feature. I always wanted to write a
        clone of the famous Atari game
        <a href="http://google.com/search?q=atari+qbert">Q-Bert</a>
        in C64 assembler but being 14 years old I couldn't get
        my head around interrupt driven programming. So I didn't get much
        further than writing a level editor.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the 1990s I had an Intel 386 PC but I never liked it, especially not
        the Windows 3.1 that came preinstalled. I had lost touch with the geek
        world at that time and felt pretty dumb using M$ Office for writing
        seminar papers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Things only got better when I came across UNIX at the university and
        later installed SuSE Linux 6.3 on my second PC, a Celeron 333MHz. Over
        the years I wasn't satisfied with SuSE anymore and learned about
        <a href="http://www.debian.org/">Debian GNU/Linux</a> and used it
        ever since.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nowadays I use Debian on all my machines at home, including a Toshiba Satellite laptop.
        I used to use the KDE 3.5 desktop but switched to <a href="http://xfce.org/">XFCE</a>
        during the KDE 4 disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am also the proud owner of a
        <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=WRT54GL">Linksys WRT54GL</a>
        router. The "L" stands for Linux, the original firmware is Linux based
        and many improved third party versions exist. I use the powerful yet
        user-friendly <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ddwrt">ddwrt</a>
        firmware.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another home device is a Bubba/2 home server from
        <a href="http://www.excito.com/">Excito</a> in Sweden. It comes with Debian
        pre-installed on a PowerPC architecture, is silent (fanless) and small.
        It has a 1 Terabyte harddrive and eSata ports.
        We use it mainly as a file and download server.
    </p>
    <p>
        In terms of gadgets, I own a <a href="http://www.kobobooks.com/ereaders">Kobo</a>
        WiFi eReader, which is also powered by Linux. I like it for its simplicity and
        support of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB">EPUB</a> format.
